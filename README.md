This is the JS audio visualiser that syncs with your audio to provide you the spectrum-like animation.

****NOTE*****
1) This is just a basic example of how it works and how it can be made. You can always edit and customize/modify it for your use.
2) The play/pause button on media controls (audio::-webkit-media-controls-play/pause) might not work but you can anytime resolve the issue.
3) This is not made by the hardcore developer rather by a learner.

ENJOY.
